#Introduction

Statistics states that each year, at least 1000 people are killed in traffic accidents in New York State.
For the most recent year reported, 371k traffic collisions occurred throughout the state of New York. These crashed have resulted in over 1k fatalities, 12k serious injuries. Over 100k additional people have suffered minor to moderate injuries in these accidents. These accidents are scattered across the five major boroughs of New York.

                      Brooklyn
                      Queens
                      Bronx
                      Manhattan
                      Staten Island
                      
While there have been many theories behind what have been the main causes of these accidents, the goal of my case study is to perform an in-depth analysis on the historic crashed to identify specific trends, derive insights and present strong recommendations based on the results obtained.
I have utilized the open data provided by the New York government which contains details on the crash events recorded.
